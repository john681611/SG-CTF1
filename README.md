# Resolving security issues challenge
This challenge is a little different to the previous challenge using this app.
Here we are going to fix the security issues. 

## Reported issues
I've created some issues on the github repo of issues that have been found by security, you are to fix or improve the security them while maintaining functionality.

## Other issues
There are more security issues that exist within the site you can fix them for bonus points

## Submissions
Fork the repo to your own **Personal** github, and make a PR to the original Repo,
You can do use a huge help by commenting on the pr and linking the changes to each issue or explain the weakness you found

NB: Don't bother removing flags as they are markers of access to something insecure.
